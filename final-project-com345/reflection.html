    <h1 class="text-center px-3">Reflection</h1>
      <h2 class="dek text-center">Why did we focus on this issue?</h2>


      <p class="graf">For our project, we decided to focus in on women in sports broadcasting, creating a toolkit in the form of a website for the Association for Women in Sports broadcasting that explores the role of sexism and patriarchy in the field, particularly in regards to football. As is likely of little surprise to anyone, women are not particularly well represented within the world of sports broadcasting: by one estimate from Zippia, women only held roughly 20.9% of jobs in sports broadcasting in 2021. </p>

      <p>This is in comparison to 2010, in which women only held approximately 19.8% of jobs. While this does technically mark roughly one percent more sports broadcasting positions being held by women, such a small increase over the course of 11 years shows a continued lack of change within the culture of sports and sports broadcasting as a whole—in regards to those behind the scenes, those on camera, and those watching at home—that pushes women away from the profession and harms those who choose to venture into it. </p>
  
    <p>This lack of representation of women in sports broadcasting both supports and exemplifies the androcentrism the profession is seeped in. That is to say, the male perspective is treated as the dominant perspective, while the perspectives of women are treated more as outliers and, in comparison, less notable. In our project, we explore how this has resulted in discrepancies in the roles women are often made to hold, alongside the stories they are placed and/or expected to report on.</p>

     <p>For one, we examined the role of hypersexualization—or the emphasis placed on a person or group of people on sex above other attributes—and the detrimental prevalence of it among women in sports broadcasting. Unlike their male counterparts, female broadcasters in sports are portrayed in a hegemonically feminine way – usually with hyperfeminine clothes and perfectly curled hair. This is to appeal to the male gaze, as sports audiences primarily consist of heterosexual men. </p>

           <blockquote class="pullquote text-center"> “Being a Black woman, period, you feel like you have to work harder to prove yourself. That’s constant in the sports industry, as well,” - Sytonnia Moore</blockquote>

    <p> We hope to analyze these trends through a feminist perspective, in other words, to find way to be inclusive of all types of women with a variety of characteristics — women who find themselves outside of hegemonic femininity, who are still deserving of praise and recognition in the sports world. For example, women like Mary Garber, who would wear newsboy caps and cover a variety of different sports. Over the course of her career, she would win 40 awards for her coverage, with the Association of Women in Sports Media naming their annual award after her. </p>

    <p>Moreover, its important to recognize that women of color are historically underrepresented in sports media, but celebrate them as well. For example, Sytonnia Moore is the current co-host of KISS 104.1 FM’s The Morning Groove, and founder of the Moore Help Foundation of Atlanta, Inc. She has boasted an impressive career spanning over 25 years, but has recognized that her fight for recognition hasn’t been easy, as she has been hypersexualized and looked down upon herself. </p>

    <p>In an interview with <a href="https://coveteur.com/2020/07/30/black-women-sports-journalism/">Coveteur</a>, she says, “Being a Black woman, period, you feel like you have to work harder to prove yourself. That’s constant in the sports industry, as well,” with broadcaster Meghan McPeak adding, “Whether it’s social media or even walking down the street and being recognized, women that cover sports are held to a higher standard. Our knowledge is put into question—we are quizzed as to what we know, and even when we show a better knowledge of something than those questioning us, we are still not given the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

    <p>This is exemplified in the number of women within sports broadcasting itself. According to a 2023 study conducted by Simone H. Eli, anchoring positions were made up of 84.4% men compare to 15.6% of women. Among reporters, 72.7% were men, with only 27.3% women, with male hosts boasting 82.2% compared to 17.8% women. Most saddeningly, however, Play By Play analysts were made up of 95.3% men compared to only 4.7% women. We found that misogyny played a significant role in the Play By Play statistics especially, as there is a common stereotype that women “don’t know sports,” and can’t be trusted to provide commentary on the fly as well as men.</p>

    <p>As a result, female broadcasters in sports (if they are hired at all), are reduced to sideline commentators. During broadcasts, they are perfectly neat and poised, with not a hair out of place. In addition, they tend to be conventionally attractive, and consistently wear feminine clothing regardless of the weather.</p> 

    <p>This results in the social cognitive theory associated with women in sports, or the theory that people copy what they see in the media, or internalize ideas associated with a certain group based on what they watch. When men rarely see women in positions of power or influence in sports media, they begin to associate women with being unable to hold positions with more responsibility, hence decreasing the amount of women in the industry.</p> 

         <blockquote class="pullquote text-center"> "We found that misogyny played a significant role in the Play By Play statistics especially, as there is a common stereotype that women 'don’t know sports,' and can’t be trusted to provide commentary on the fly as well as men."</blockquote>

    <p>Women in the sports industry deserve a chance to break free of the gender polarization that keeps them contained in a hyperfeminine space. They deserve to call plays, host after-game shows, and promote their individual work. In order to do so, however, it’s imperative to internally redefine what it means to be a female sports broadcaster, and support the women who are making their mark on their field. In addition, its important to support organizations like the Association of Women in Sports Media, who are dedicated to mentoring young journalists, and providing them with the resources and opportunities to make change.</p> 

    <p>Moreover, its important to reflect on our own biases, and challenge ourselves to think differently when confronted with these issues – especially through an intersectional lens, since women of color have historically been left out of feminist spaces. While we recognize that change certainly doesn’t happen overnight, we truly hope that this toolkit is a step in the right direction.</p>
